Multiple Sclerosis Biological Network. A Pubmed search was performed pm 12/12/19 with term "multiple sclerosis". The file was downloaded as text file. Next, R package pubmed.mineR was used to search genes from a library. Latent semantic analysis was performed using a list of terms against the genes. The data was saved as graphml file and exported to Gephi 0.9.2 for visualisation & community detection. The interactive graph is available [here](https://gntem2.github.io/MS-Biological-Network/). The interactive file was created using Sigma Exporter plugins in Gephi. Before visualisation, a manual editing step is required. The node names need to be copy from Name column to Label column in Gephi data laboratory.
